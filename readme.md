# I. What is YodaPy?
[⇧ *Top*](#contents-page)

Luke Skywalker is a young padawan who wants to know anything about the universe. So he asked Yoda each time he wants to know the adress of the [Dernier bar](http://dernierbar.com/).
Yoda answer by giving him the exact adress and a pin on a map. But Yoda is chatty, so he often tell a story about the place.

YodaPy is a project for the Python path from [OpenClassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/paths/68-developpeur-dapplication-python).
